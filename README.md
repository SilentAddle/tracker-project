Welcome to your Python project on Cloud9 IDE!

To show what Cloud9 can do, we added a basic sample web application to this
workspace, from the excellent Python tutorial _Learning Python the Hard Way_.
We skipped ahead straight to example 50 which teaches how to build a web
application.

If you've never looked at the tutorial or are interested in learning Python,
go check it out. It's a great hands-on way for learning all about programming
in Python.

## Extending the User Profile
In order to extend the user profile, code was sampled from this django tutorial project.

## User Authentication
The user authentication used in this project was cloned from the previous "e-commerce" project.
